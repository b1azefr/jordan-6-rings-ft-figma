# Experience the future of sneaker design with Nike Jordan 6 Rings!ðŸ‘ŸðŸš€



# Introduction
So i have been messing around with figma for a few days, just to get a jist of it. Now that i think i have got to know enough of figma, i gave it a shot with my first project on figma. I have always been super curious about shoes in general, which brought me to this idea of trying to clone a famous shoe brand, Nike. This is a design made completely from scratch, without any pre-existing templates or layouts.

# Plugins used
In my first project, i utilized the "iconify" plugin, which helped me getting all the icons i needed for this project.

Here's the link to the plugin: [iconify](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/iconify)
